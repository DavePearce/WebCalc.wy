# WebCalc.wy

A very simple web-based calculator written in Whiley.  This
illustrates the ability to write clean, functional code in a reactive
style for the web.  You can see a live demo
[here](https://davepearce.github.io/WebCalc.wy/).  You can also see
the Whiley source [here](https://github.com/DavePearce/WebCalc.wy/blob/master/src/main.whiley) and the generated JavaScript [here](https://github.com/DavePearce/WebCalc.wy/blob/master/bin/js/main.js).
